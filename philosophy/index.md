## Work culture

We aspire to do high-quality science. We foster a positive and supportive space to work in. We strive to be good lab citizens, generous with our time and know-how. We give honest, constructive feedback and celebrate each other's victories. We promote flexible work timings and mutual respect to everyone's time. We welcome diversity and admire our differences. We value passion, persistence and healthy productivity.

## Open Science

We believe in open science. We are committed to openness and transparency at every stage of our research. All lab members have access to every experiment, reagent, data point, and code through a [shared ELN](https://elabftw.parafugelab.com/). We make all of this data public at the time of preprint. We always preprint. We publish in open-access journals or ensure our articles are made open-access. We make lab protocols public. We are constantly exploring effective ways to make our research more accessible.

## Research Integrity

We value honesty and take pride in our work. We follow best practices to produce results that can be verified and reproduced. Our research outputs are mapped to acquired data, raw images and detailed experiment records. We are comfortable with finding our favourite hypotheses disproved. We include negative results in our publications. Mistakes are openly discussed to understand why they happened and how to avoid them in the future. Due credit is given by properly citing research, tools, ideas and people. We discuss authorships early on in a project and revisit them as projects evolve, guided by [CRediT](https://credit.niso.org/).

## Mentorship

We aim to produce good scientists. We encourage lab members of all career stages to think intentionally about their career goals, short- and long-term. Well-rounded support can be expected from the PI - feasible plan for training and career development, regular 1-2-1 meetings and a push for tangible research outputs to evidence your work. Projects are tailored to mentee's aspirations and mentoring style to mentee needs. PI availability for timely feedback and advice is a guarantee.
