Our research focuses on identifying the critical functions of genes that these parasites rely on to survive in the bloodstream. We disrupt specific genes and closely study how this affects the parasite, and we do this at scale to speed up discoveries. These fascinating explorations take place at the School of Infection and Immunity, University of Glasgow.</subtitle><entry><title type="html">Welcome Anagha!</title><link href="https://parafugelab.com/2024/11/18/example-post-1.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Welcome Anagha!" /><published>2024-11-18T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-01-03T20:04:38+00:00</updated><id>https://parafugelab.com/2024/11/18/example-post-1</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://parafugelab.com/2024/11/18/example-post-1.html"><![CDATA[<p>Welcoming Anagha who will be joining the lab as our Technician and first member of the lab!!</p>]]></content><author><name>abhinay-ramaprasad</name></author><category term="biology" /><category term="medicine" /><category term="big data" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Welcoming Anagha who will be joining the lab as our Technician and first member of the lab!!]]></summary></entry></feed>
