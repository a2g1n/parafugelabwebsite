# {% include headicons.html icon="fa-solid fa-users" %}Team

We are a fresh and dynamic malaria lab situated within Glasgowâ€™s vibrant parasitology community. We love constructing plasmids, culturing malaria parasites and disrupting genes, and are always looking for better and more efficient ways to get these done. 
The mutants we generate often lead us down intriguing and unexpected paths of enquiry, pushing us to continuously learn, collaborate and imbibe new techniques and technologies.

We foster a lab environment that is positive, inclusive and supportive, where diversity in skills and perspectives are celebrated and encouraged. Learn more about our <a href="../values/index.html">approach to science</a>.

## Join us

At the lab, we routinely identify interesting essential genes that could be investigated further to uncover their important roles in the parasite. With this as a starting point, we can shape projects around your interests and also offer support to help create strong proposals for independent fellowships or studentships. Feel free to contact us to discuss opportunities!
