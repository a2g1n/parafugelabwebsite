Our current quest is to understand how malaria parasites reproduce asexually within red blood cells. The parasite undergoes an extraordinary form of cell division called schizogony, where the parasiteâ€™s nucleus divides multiple times before the cell itself undergoes a form of cytokinesis, producing up to 24 daughter parasites. Many features of this process remain a mystery, including how the parasite initiates this phase and regulates its timing. We want to understand how such key decisions are taken and identify the molecules and mechanisms that are involved. Through our efforts we hope to The blood stages of the malaria parasite are clinically important, as they are responsible for the symptomatic phase of the disease. 

Malaria remains a devastating disease and a significant global health challenge. The blood stages of the malaria parasite are clinically important, as they are responsible for the symptomatic phase of the disease. To survive and propagate through its asexual life stages within red blood cells, the parasite relies on nearly half of its ~5000 protein-coding genes. However, the functions of many of these genes remain unknown. At the Parasite Functional Genetics Lab (ParaFuGe Lab), we aim to uncover the critical roles of these essential genes in the most lethal malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum.

To achieve this, we develop and employ scalable, inducible gene knockout approaches to study gene function. These tools enable us to systematically disrupt specific genes in the parasite at a desired point in time and generate multiple mutant lines. By studying these mutants using advanced -omics, biochemical, and imaging technologies, we aim to uncover the mechanisms of action of said genes to reveal new aspects of parasite biology.
