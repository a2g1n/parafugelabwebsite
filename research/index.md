Our current quest is to understand how malaria parasites reproduce asexually within red blood cells. The parasite undergoes an extraordinary form of cell division called schizogony, where the parasiteâ€™s nucleus divides multiple times before the entire cell splits all at once, producing up to 24 daughter parasites. Many features of this process remain a mystery. How does the parasite know when to start dividing? How does it time each step in this process? And how does it know when to stop after making a certain number of daughter parasites? We want to understand how these crucial decisions are made and identify the molecules and mechanisms involved. We hope that this will lead to new insights into how the parasite proliferates in the blood - the primary cause of clinical symptoms - and eventually to developing new drugs to combat this devastating disease.



To study the asexual blood stages of the parasite, we use We develop and employ scalable, inducible gene disruption approaches to uncover new gene functions. These tools enable us to systematically disrupt specific genes in the parasite at a desired point in time and generate multiple mutant lines. By studying these mutants using advanced -omics, biochemical, and imaging technologies, we aim to uncover the mechanisms of action of said genes to reveal new aspects of parasite biology.
To survive and propagate through its asexual life stages within red blood cells, the parasite relies on nearly half of its ~5000 protein-coding genes. However, the functions of many of these genes remain unknown.
