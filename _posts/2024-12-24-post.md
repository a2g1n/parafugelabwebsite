We wanted to codify how we design the DiCre strategy to inducibly knockout a gene, something we do often in the lab. This is mainly to guide new students and lab members. But hey why not out in [protocols.io](https://dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.eq2ly68begx9/v1), someone might find it useful. Well done Anagha for the lab's first DOI!
