Hi, I'm Abigail. I completed my BSc in Biochemistry and Human Biology, followed by an MRes in Bioscience (Infectious Disease) at Keele University. My MRes research focused on the role of large multigene families in Plasmodium parasites, with a particular focus on Plasmodium knowlesi.  

Through this work, I developed a strong interest in malaria research and Plasmodium biology, especially the molecular mechanisms that drive parasite development and adaptation. I became particularly interested in the parasite’s unusual cell biology and life cycle, including how the parasite's unique form of division is regulated. Now, as a PhD student, I continue to explore these interests and remain motivated by understanding how these processes contribute to parasite survival and disease. 

Outside of the lab, I enjoy reading, puzzles, and learning Mandarin.
