I am an MRC Career Development Research Fellow at the School of Infection and Immunity, University of Glasgow, where I lead research on the asexual blood-stage proliferation of malaria parasites. My lab develops and uses scalable, inducible gene knockout approaches to discover essential gene function in the most lethal human malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum.

Previously, I was a Marie Skłodowska-Curie Fellow in Prof. Mike Blackman’s lab at the Francis Crick Institute, London (2018-24) where I investigated the roles of several protein families - phospholipases, perforin-like proteins and rhomboid proteases - during the parasite's replication cycle within red blood cells. Before that, I conducted my doctoral research in the labs of Prof. Arnab Pain in King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, Saudi Arabia and Prof. Richard Culleton in Nagasaki Institute of Tropical Medicine, Japan (2012-17) where I established a genetic resource for an under-utilized rodent malaria model, Plasmodium vinckei.
