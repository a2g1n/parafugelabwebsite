Hi, I’m Anagha! I’m originally from India, and I’m currently on a wild ride in the world of malaria research at the ParaFuGe Lab. I completed my BSc in Biotechnology at Ramnarain Ruia College, which is affiliated with Mumbai University, and then I moved to the University of Glasgow for my MSc in Biotechnology. Now I’m diving into the mysteries of malaria! As a Technician, I get to do all sorts of fun things, like culturing malaria parasites, building plasmids, and playing around with gene disruptions. It’s challenging, but that’s what makes it exciting! Outside the lab, I’m usually baking something delicious or jamming out to music because everything’s better with a good beat, right?
