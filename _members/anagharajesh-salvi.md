Hi, I’m Anagha! I’m originally from India. I completed my BSc in Biotechnology at Ramnarain Ruia College (Mumbai University), and then I moved to the University of Glasgow for my MSc in Biotechnology. Now I’m diving into the mysteries of malaria! As a Tech, I get to do all sorts of fun things - culture malaria parasites in red blood cells, use Cas9 to modify parasite genes and DiCre to knock them out. It’s challenging, but that’s what makes it exciting! Outside helping to build a lab from scratch, I’m usually baking something delicious or jamming out to music because everything’s better with a good beat, right?
