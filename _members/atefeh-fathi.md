Hi, I’m Atefeh, my friends also call me Ati! I am originally from Iran. I began my career as a veterinarian in Iran, earning my degree in veterinary medicine and spending three years treating four-legged patients, from stubborn cats to overexcited puppies. My curiosity about parasites led me to Japan, where I completed a PhD in veterinary parasitology at snowy wonderland, Hokkaido. I investigated how Babesia bovis modifies the structure of red blood cells and causes cerebral babesiosis, using genetic knockouts/downs to uncover its tricks. Working with Babesia, a close relative of malaria parasites, and attending malaria conferences sparked my fascination with Plasmodium biology. Now, as a postdoc, I’m diving into the world of Plasmodium falciparum to understand how this parasite replicates within the RBC.
Outside the lab, you’ll find me skiing down snowy slopes one day and curled up with a good book the next, I love balancing adventure with quiet moments. I also love sharing my adventures online as a social media content creator.
